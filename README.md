# Template for new go (echo) + templ + alpine + htmx + tailwind projects

I gave up trying to come up with a clever stack name also I am fairly
confident that I am far from the first and only person to do this. Given
that and my general inexperience in the webdev world I found it hard to find
a general guide that documented the steps to make a project using the 
dependencies in the title without relying on cdn's for any of the js libraries.

To start 
```
git clone git@github.com:markome-beep/go-templ-alpine-htmx-tailwind-Template.git new-project -o template
cd new-project
npm install
npm run build
```
